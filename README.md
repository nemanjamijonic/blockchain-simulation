# Project for Software Development Elements

## Blockchain

This project, developed in C# within the .NET environment, simulates the workings of a Blockchain system. It features a Client submitting data, which is processed by a SmartContract and solved by Miners. The Miners solve mathematical problems to validate transactions, and the verified blocks are added to the Blockchain. The miner who solves the problem is rewarded with an increase in their Bitcoin balance.
